# Discord Metro

![Discord Metro banner](banner.png)

Discord Metro is an experimental interaction framework for a Discord guild that emulates a city with a metro system.

Status:
 - You can configure stations and trains, and have the trains go around the stations. There's a cool map that shows up when you do.
 - No role assignments yet, you'll have to find a different way to switch roles for now.
 - I completely forgot how much this would spam the API so I guess I'll have to shelve it for now.
